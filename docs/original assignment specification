1) [4 p] Write any assembly-integrated C program as you wish that satisfies the following conditions:

* The program should involve at least one array and do some array operations of your choice.
* Array operations should be performed through the Assembly portion of the code, at least in part.
* There should be at least two separate asm volatile ( ) functions with different ARM Assembly code blocks in them.
* Assembly portions of the code should, in total, contain at least 20 different instructions.
* Assembly portions of the code should, in total, contain at least 50 instructions.
* An instruction cannot be repeated more than 5 times. If you need to, consider using a variation of it or find another workaround. 
* The program should read and write data to and from the RAM for a specific purpose (e.g., storing an array).
* Variables of any kind are defined in the C portion of the code.
* The last section of the C code must print a few variables to verify the results.
