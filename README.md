ARM CPU Design Project

OVERVIEW:
This project involved designing a simplified ARM-based CPU architecture from the ground up. The objective was to develop detailed schematics for all major subsystems and validate instruction execution through ARM assembly programs.

MOTIVATION:
To deepen my understanding of computer architecture beyond theoretical coursework by implementing datapath and control logic at the schematic level and verifying hardware-compatible assembly execution.

SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE:
The CPU design included -
* Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
* Control Unit
* Instruction Register
* Data Memory
* Cache
* Multiplexers
* Register File

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
* ARM Assembly
* Segger Embedded Studio
* Altium Designer
* Digital Logic Schematic Modeling

DESIGN & IMPLEMENTATION:
The datapath was structured to support arithmetic operations, memory access, and branch instructions. Control signals were generated through a structured control unit to synchronize instruction decoding and execution stages.

CHALLENGES:
One key challenge was ensuring proper synchronization between control signals and data movement across subsystems. Instruction-level debugging was used to validate correct register updates and execution flow.

TESTING & VALIDATION:
Assembly test programs were written to verify arithmetic operations, memory reads/writes, and instruction sequencing. Debugging confirmed correct execution behavior across implemented instruction sets.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
* Strengthened understanding of instruction pipelines and control logic
* Gained practical experience in hardware-level debugging
* Improved ability to translate theoretical architecture into functional design
